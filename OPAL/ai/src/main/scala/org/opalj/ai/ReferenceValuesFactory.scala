     *
     * ==General Remarks==
     * The given type usually identifies a class type (not an interface type) that is
     * not abstract, but in some cases (e.g. consider `java.awt.Toolkit()`)
     * it may be useful/meaningful to relax this requirement and to state that the
     * class precisely represents the runtime type â€“ even
     * so the class is abstract. However, such decisions need to be made by the domain.
     *
     * This method is used by the OPAL framework to create reference values that are normally
     * internally created by the JVM (in particular exceptions such as
     * `NullPointerException` and `ClassCastException`). However, it can generally
     * be used to create initialized objects/arrays.
     *
     * ==Summary==
     * The properties of the domain value are:
     *  - Initialized: '''Yes'''
     *  - Type: '''precise''' (i.e., this type is not an upper bound, the type
     *      correctly models the runtime type.)
     *  - Null: '''No''' (This value is not `null`.)
