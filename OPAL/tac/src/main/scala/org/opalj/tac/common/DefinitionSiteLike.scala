/**
 * Identifies a definition site object in a method in the bytecode using its program counter.
 * It corresponds to the [[org.opalj.br.fpcf.properties.EscapeProperty]] and the computing
 * analyses.
 * Concrete definition sites are usually associated with [[DefinitionSite]].
 * However, to compute the [[org.opalj.br.fpcf.properties.FieldLocality]] it is necessary to
 * represent definition site objects that have a reduced usedBy set (PutField's are removed here).
 * Therefore, this trait acts as a common interface for such objects.
