/**
 * Describes the alias properties of the associated entities.
 *
 * Alias properties can establish a binding between a pair of entities, including definition sites, formal parameters, method return values, fields, etc.
 * For more information, see [[org.opalj.tac.fpcf.analyses.alias.AliasSourceElement]] and [[org.opalj.tac.fpcf.analyses.alias.AliasEntity]].
 * The pair may consist of different types of entities, such as a field and a formal parameter.
 *
 * An alias property provides information about the relationship of the memory locations of the associated entities.
 *
 *  - [[NoAlias]] can be assigned to a pair of entities, iff no execution path exists where both entities refer to the same memory location.
 *   This implies that there is a definite separation of the memory locations of the two entities, and no interference can occur when one of the entities is referenced.
 *   Note that this does not imply that, for example, the fields of the entities cannot refer to the same memory location.
 *   Example:
 *   {{{
 *     Object m(Object a) {
 *       Object b = new Object();
 *       return b;
 *     }
 *   }}}
 *   In this example, the formal parameter `a` and the local variable `b` are guaranteed to never refer to the same memory location,
 *   as `b` is always assigned to a new object that the formal parameter can't possibly be pointing to since the object has not been created before the method call.
 *   This ensures that the method's return value and the formal parameter never point to the same memory location.
 *
 *  - [[MustAlias]] can be assigned to a pair of entities, iff both entities refer to the same memory location in every execution time at all times.
 *   This implies that at every use site of one entity, it can be replaced with the other entity (if it is defined at the current location) without changing the semantics of the program.
 *   Example:
 *   {{{
 *    Object m() {
 *      Object a = new Object();
 *      Object b = a;
 *      return b;
 *    }
 *   }}}
 *   In this example, the local variable `a` and `b` are guaranteed to refer to the same memory location at all times,
 *   because a is only assigned once and b is only defined once with the value of a.
 *   This means that the return value of the method can be replaced with `a`.
 *
 *  - [[MayAlias]] can always be assigned to any given pair of entities without invalidating the results.
 *   It indicates that the two entities might refer to the same memory location but are not obligated to do so.
 *   This serves as a default/fallback value when no other property can be guaranteed.
 *   Example:
 *   {{{
 *     Object m(Object a) {
 *       Object b = a;
 *       System.out.println(b);
 *       b = new Object();
 *       return b;
 *     }
 *   }}}
 *   In this example neither [[MustAlias]] nor [[NoAlias]] can be assigned to the pair of formal parameter `a` and local variable `b`,
 *   because b initially refers to the same memory location as a but is later assigned to a new object.
 *
 * Note that the examples above are usually already optimized by the compiler and are used for illustrative purposes.
 *
 * The alias properties are ordered and form a lattice with the following order: [[MayAlias]] > [[MustAlias]] > [[NoAlias]].
 * This means that [[MayAlias]] is the most precise property and [[NoAlias]] is the least precise property.
 * This allows for an analysis to return [[NoAlias]] as an intermediate result when no further information is available
 * (because there is no reason to assume it can alias) and later refine it to [[MustAlias]] or even [[MayAlias]] if more
 * information becomes available that indicate a [[MayAlias]] or [[MustAlias]] relation.
 * An analysis is not allowed to return a less precise property than the one that was previously assigned to the same pair of entities.
 *
 * An analysis should attempt to be as sound as possible when assigning [[MustAlias]] or [[NoAlias]] properties,
 * but might not always be able to do so, e.g. when a field is changed via reflection or native methods.
 * In such cases, the analysis should document the possible unsoundness.
 *
 * Alias information is only defined at a location where both entities of the associated pair are defined.
 * If one of the entities is not defined at the current location, the given alias property holds no information.
